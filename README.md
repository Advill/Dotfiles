# Dotfiles
Dotfiles for tmux, zsh, bash, and vim.

Included with a script to create symlinks for each, as well as to save backups
of old files.

There are a few extra peices not included here, namely 
[Nightshell](https://www.github.com/nightsense/nightshell) and 
[Hyperzsh](https://www.github.com/tylerreckart/hyperzsh), both of which can be
installed very easily from their repositories, or removed from here, as neither
of them are required.
